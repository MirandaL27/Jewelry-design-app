        Heavy jewelry was common during this time as well as bolder pieces that reflected the changing roles
        for women at the time. Gypsy and Pave settings were used to hold gems.  A Gypsy setting has little prongs that hold
        the gem in place, whereas a pave setting has almost invisible prongs. Archeological digs continued during this period,
        generating great public curiosity. 
        Thus, Ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian designs remained popular and inspired cameo use. 
        Excavations of Ancient Etruscan cities in Italy brought about a revival of Etruscan designs in jewelry. 
        In particular, an ancient metal technique featuring fine, beaded granulation was resurrected.`,

        Materials such as bog oak, coral, ivory, and tortoiseshell were also used as gems.
        Goldstone, a glass gem simulant, was widely used.
        Notable gem cutting styles included the following:
        Rose Cut: round shape with a domed top and flat bottom.
